# SPEED TEST

I'm using JavaScript (Fetch API and XMLHttpRequest) to measure both download and upload speeds.
I could use fetch for both upload and download, but I'm trying to compare the old-fashioned XMLHttpRequest with the newer fetch API.
Using both XMLHttpRequest (the old-fashioned way) and Fetch API (the modern approach) is beneficial for comparing their performance and compatibility.
